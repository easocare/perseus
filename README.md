## Features

Features of Atlas

## Local Installation and setup

After cloning or forking this repository, you should install all dependencies on your machine:

```shell
# with npm
npm install

# or with Yarn
yarn
```

With the dependencies and configuration in place, you can start the server in development mode:

```shell
# with npm
npm start

# or with Yarn
yarn start
```

## Usage

You'd be using Atlas in one of 2 ways:

1. Start afresh with no data, One would acquire a `trip_summary` or `LineString` geoJSON; either paste the JSON as text in the text field, or upload one of the JSON type through the file input field. Once validated, `Update` button, would close the modal, and plot the location data on to the map
2. Atlas is loaded with a gist URL. In such scenario, Atlas would fetch the json from the gist (both public gists, and private gists are supported) and update the text field. Once validated, `Update` button, would close the modal, and plot the location data on to the map. <br/> The gist url can be supplied as a [URL search parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) `gist`. <br/> Eg: `https://hypertrack.github.io/atlas2/?gist=https://gist.github.com/SahRckr/c6ee0dd9b7bd605f8ca9d9b43561387d`

The validation of input will prohibit the input overlay to close and list out known problems in the input.
